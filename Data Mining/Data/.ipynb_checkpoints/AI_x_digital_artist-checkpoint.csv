I really enjoyed this video and how Mr. Khan shared how he thinks AI could transform the classroom and help students. This is a topic I am interested in, and I am diving deeper into how I can safely incorporate it into my classroom. Most of your videos in your playlist were around the topic of AI, but then you also had videos that did a good job covering other topics such as online safety, cyberbullying, and protecting your privacy. While many of your videos would be too advanced for my elementary students, I think they would be a perfect addition to any middle or high school classroom. Overall, the videos did a great job of making digital citizenship feel important and highlighted the growing topic of AI. Thanks for sharing."
17,2025-04-26T05:47:06Z,@bigjaw93,"what guardrails would you end up putting for the tutors who would be eligible to teach these students anymore?
Because now more than ever we need to make sure that the tutors that teach the students are technically aware of:
how to use AI models
how to fine-tune them should there be issues with it

That ends up creating a whole layer of maintenance that's required to make sure that these models work properly, especially when it comes to:

Edge cases: like a student finding a loophole to the model. 
Extra time and effort spend in maintaining these models.

Are we expecting all of these tutors to be young and vibrant and to be able to deal with the I can deliver these issues?
Are we still ensuring that the tutors or the teachers that are academically knowledgeable are still relevant in this case?"

21,2025-04-17T23:19:26Z,@workingTchr,"3:13 ""It's able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student's mind"". I don't think so.  It's articulating how the student's answer is imperfect, which is not the same.  To be an effective tutor, we have to first train AI to understand how people think rather than just how to solve problems.  The great difficulty with this is what will AI have to _learn from_ ?  Unless we find some way to train AI how humans think, (or until AI acquires sentience, and with that, presumably, empathy), I think it'll be a long way from being the sort of effective tutor that Sal Khan envisions."

Human beings' design and development Chakras and brain are all linked and human intelligence has to be first enabled.  So , for many it will be improving but it is actually enabling options and helping to think...as  majority ( who has used AI tools) nowadays has stopped thinking and ask Ai stratighway questions"
25,2025-04-15T01:00:46Z,@JCol-o3n,"AI can be helpful in education. It shouldn‚Äôt be used to make everyone think alike or create narrow and limited paths to truth. We have never gotten all of our water from the same place. In essence AI gives us all the same water troff, around the world. This could be hazardous if it limits the direction of physics or mathematics. If it creates broad and tighter models, yes even unintentionally perhaps. It could be making very basic decisions for everyone that they will no longer get to decide. We don‚Äôt want youths to be filled like vessels by AI, we want them to think the small things out as they grow. This is normal so they know how they got there. It needs to be done individually on an individual road in order to protect the quantum fields of infinity. AI can be a shortcut. Do we want it? Yes, if it helps with math. But we also want children to learn in very unique ways. This process helps students in life. Marita may go home and get a Khan Academy video. Jesi may have his older brother explain it. It‚Äôs good to have infinite sources and to not value one over the other because processes render different answers in life.

The fact so many will choose a computer as teacher does impact society. It can make instruction more accurate, but it also could mean personal teaching won‚Äôt be preferred or necessary in 20 years. Is that good? Maybe. How much contact do kids and people want. We already spend so much time on phones not communicating with people. That with AI will increase. Do people want to interact with other people as much? These are the decisions that AI makes for society at a base level. The decisions about advancements and the small details, even in degrees, will lead to a different destination. That‚Äôs why thinking about AI impacts are imoortant.

AI right now is not artificial intelligence. It‚Äôs just computers retrieving information in an ordered way to be more helpful to the user. Computers are learning more and more to speak our language fluently and order the information it keeps in its memory. The tasks it can do well are ones that demand accuracy.

The ‚ÄúAI revolution‚Äù is not to be compared to the computer revolution. That was much larger. Quantum computers could be the game changer again. So far the hype about Chat GPT is hype. I can tell when it is being used and the quality of written materials have declined. I can tell when I‚Äôm getting a canned response in my email. I ignore the bulk mail. I‚Äôll read the hand written one sent to me. So Id call AI Automatic response based on programmer & info at hand. Is it convenient? Yes. Is it limited and can be wildly inaccurate? Yes."

31,2025-03-30T16:24:41Z,@WilliamSteMarie-or4sh,"This is certainly one of the more positive ways to use AI. I see a lot of potential in having AI use the socratic method rather than spitting out answers. However, I have many concerns: If you can just ask a character its motivations or what something symbolizes, where is the act of interpretation? Also, who is to say there is one correct interpretation or that the AI's one is accurate? Also, a lot of people talk about lesson planning like it's a chore and not  an important part of a teacher's imprint/philosophy. I know that for me, lesson planning is a huge part of my instruction, and it is very closely tied to my teaching philosophy/who I am.  Having AI write with you seems like a decent idea, but it sort of devalues just how important choices are in writing and your voice as a writer. Could you imagine if the greats just tag-teamed their novels with AI? How would their voice be consistent? How much of the plot/creative choices would be influenced by something regurgitating random things? How much do students come to rely on AI for help? Does this make them feel less comfortable asking a teacher for help? What happens when it hallucinates? Will the students believe the teacher over the AI? Eventually, will the teachers even know the AI is hallucinating or will they also become overreliant?"
32,2025-03-26T12:00:53Z,@jonathaningram6011,"This is really just a commercial for Khan Academy.  Most of what is presented will not improve education.  It will do just the opposite.  Let me take one example from the video.

In the video, Mr. Khan describes a student that had the AI talk to her in ""the voice"" of the Jay Gatsby and ask about the meaning of the green light he looks at in the distance.  The AI gives her an explanation, and it is a fine explanation.  However, the assumption is that education means getting the answer.  That is precisely wrong!

To be educated, the student needs to be able to make her own connections.  She didn't do this.  If the student read the book, the book says that the green light is at the end of Daisy's dock across the bay.  The student should be able to make the connection, not be told the connection.  Telling the connection does the thinking FOR the student rather than having the student think FOR herself."

34,2025-03-24T16:55:48Z,@DentedOut,"Those that promote AI positively are mistaken.  It is not intelligence, just a faster search engine.  Whoopty-doo!  AI now writes reports and essays for an entire generation of students that can no longer can read a book, internalize that knowledge by jotting down notes and then using those notes to create an original thought or thesis, that is to be written in their own words.  By this time-intensive struggle, knowledge becomes understanding within the self, something termed Somatic Knowledge. With ChatGPT, even the act of ""cut and paste"" statements is removed.  Merely enter a prompt, (I guess this is cut and pasted) and magically a paper for marking is produced.  Many educators I know, now complain this a problem.  Increasingly, knowledge for our students is Exosomatic, in that it is never comprehended, only retrieved.  This is not KNOWING.  In his speech at the Perimeter Institute, polymath Freeman Dyson claimed that in the year 2000 it became cheaper to store information than to understand it.  Thus the general public is made increasingly dumber, which is just how our current political leaders want it. 
Early on, TED talks used to be good.  No longer.  Now it panders to promoters and influencers, who leverage their TED talk as social currency.  In the end, AI will undoubtedly give us easier acquisition to prono."

For the story writer it is literally doing half the work for the student. That is still cheating in my book. I think AI can have a place but we can't use it to just give students the answers.

We can all think back to when at school on the teachers who were good at getting information across - and those who were not. Especially in more complex subjects such as physics or, say, statistics. Why the difference? What if you could recreate the things the good teacher did? 
Most schools do not teach you how to learn. They are trying to impart info you are expected to remember and, therefore, learn. But not how to learn. Great books like Make it Stick show how most teachers don‚Äôt know or understand how we learn or how information moves from short term memory to long term memory.  When you look at how Khan Academy is structured it does apply most of that thinking. Educational departments are signing up Khan Academy - likely to supplement their programs - but many will actually learn more from Khan Academy than their classroom teacher.
We still need a real person to prod us, provoke us, encourage us to learn - so I am not proposing we get rid of teachers but there are many areas we take for granted and have not looked at more deeply. Same for the way doctors diagnose patients. They all do it differently with varying levels of success. When anything is reliant on the variations and vagaries of individuals over a systemic approach, we are going to get dramatic variance in results."

Granted, what he showed was mind-blowing and awe-inspiring, but he never really talked about the risks, apart from the last minute (and in really vague terms).

What if students wanted to talk to an historical figure like Hitler, and the AI portrayed him as a sympathetic leader who only wanted the best for his country, ignoring the millions of victims of his dictatorship?

What if a private AI company received fundings by oil companies to make the AI teach that climate change is not so real after all?

Also, Khan said that safeguards and regulations should be put in place, but he never told what policies they implemented on their own AI.

Letting one private AI company teach every subject to millions of young students sounds tempting, but creates a huge bottleneck, because who controls that single AI controls what the students learn.

This is why this talk looked like a giant commercial to me."

The problem is perhaps the underlying idea of what the goal of school math education is (or should be). Is it making kids able to solve problem, focusing on the product (e.g. the correct solution of an equation)? Or is it helping kids developing the mathematical thinking? in the example provided the ""AI personal assistant"" points out to the correct application of a rule (distributing the factor to the numbers inside the parenthesis). However there is no help in uderstanding the ""WHY"" of such a rule. I would think that a good teacher should help stundents UNDERSTANDING why such a rule exists, working on their high level thinking skills, rather than focusing (only?) on their ability of remembering and applying a rule...but then again I am not so familiar with the Khan Academy so maybe that kind of thinking is developed in other parts of their math programme?"

Of course not.  What such systems really afford is for school districts to radically increase class size and reduce the number of costly teachers.  Taxpayers will be overjoyed at the savings.  Plus, given AI's geometric growth speed, ultimately, we either won't need teachers at all, or at least people trained in pedagogy to teach our children.

In our times it is barely possible to avoid using AI tools. But I can feel that Khanamigo is both useful and ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù at the same time.

AI is becoming a part of our world whether we like it or not, but, like all tools, we just have to ensure that it is used wisely and ethically and--especially as educators--we have to teach our students how to do the same. I think what Khan academy is doing seems like a great way to show kids how AI can be used in ways that doesn't do their thinking for them, but rather helps them become better thinkers and learners themselves."

OTOH, some of the use cases he suggests may be somewhat near-term. The right balance will be a process to strike.

I find it kind of ironic, as an English teacher, that the AI won't give the answers to a math problem, but it will tell students the meaning of symbols in the text as a character from that text. To me, that is the same as just giving the answer to the student. The point of teaching literature, in my opinion, is that the student inhabits the characters in a text and comes to their own understanding of the meanings of the characters' actions."

258,2023-11-23T23:24:34Z,@SR-gf4ce,Those tools make a simple mistake  that any experienced teacher knows.  Just because the student gave you the right answer to a specific question does not mean learning is happening.  They assume that students have learned something because they type in the correct response to a prompt.  The only thing students will learn is how to give AI  the answer it wants - just enough of an answer to stop further prompts and get the little winner's cup emoji.  They will play AI like  they play all the other games on the internet.  Real learning is far more interesting than this.

274,2023-10-31T21:49:13Z,@hamsternchips,"Sal is being naive that we are all active participants in this decision. He has a privileged perspective as a multimillionaire and Harvard grad. Everyday people will live and suffer through the rapid changes in jobs and the economy. Lots of people will be left impoverished, run over by the desires of corporations and 1%ers."
275,2023-10-31T03:00:45Z,@Sparrowthorn,"A very clear and compelling talk, as you'd expect from Sal Khan. While I'm ""all in"" on the Math, I find the Jay Gatsby example a little troubling. When a student is able to ""ask Jay Gatsby"" (the Khanmigo ""bot"") the significance of the green light on Daisy's dock then when it replies, posing as ""Jay Gatsby"", it's just spoon-feeding an answer. The student has not had to figure anything out for herself which in the arts is critical (just as much as in math). 

Why? Because reading a work of literature is an act of ""co-creation"" between writer and reader. When we read ""Gatsby"", each of us forms our own Jay Gatsby in our minds conjured by the magic Fitzgerald's words, coupled with the work of our own (unique) imagination. This is what gives art its power.

Khan's bot, however, is serving up a kind of Big Mac version of Gatsby (lots of ""old sports"" and not much else). The student's interactions with this fake (lightweight) version of the character are by definition superficial. She's not engaging in the infinitely more rewarding act of imaginative creation, in the company of a great writer. As a result her impression of the book is likely to be shaped by the bot, and not by Fitzgerald.

Last point‚ÄîI'm OK with this if it's just ""training wheels""...getting kids over the first hurdle in reading a work of literature (one that they'd probably not read without the assistance of the bot). But once the student gets some momentum, they should be encouraged‚Äîand in a school setting, required‚Äîto switch off the tech, otherwise they'll be short-changed."

Students eventually grow up, have to find jobs, support families, pay rents, utilities, healthcare etc. But how many employees top 10 tech companies would really need eventually? Will the minimum wage salaries be enough for rest of the population? How many can be lucky to get donations from Gates foundation? How many will be motivated in creating startups focused on going beyond Mars? How many students will be motivated to learn any complex subject knowing fully well they can't afford a middle class living standard even if they grind for rest of their lives. Things are already too bad for bottom 50-60% of population. We as a society really need to think where we are headed."

Perhaps the AIs can be hooked into cameras with knowledge of kinematics and help identify gymnasts or assist with woodworking skills. Hook AIs up to microphones to find singing ability or improve debating or acting ability. Children are our greatest resource. Let's find a way to uncover all of the talents they possess. It must invariably lead to greater fulfilment.

For example, when you break down the Great Gatsby to an AI interpretation and presentation, you (without knowing it) begin the process of eroding the human artist behind the work. You begin (perhaps unconsciously) to project intelligence/agency/omnipotency into a machine. In short, you eliminate the presence of the author/artist whose experience and talents (etc.) created the work to begin with! Hence, do you really understand the consequences of incorporating AI into education? I don't think Sal does or many others who endorse this unchecked AI into our society."

o  The speaker argues that AI can be used to enhance education rather than undermine it if the proper safeguards and regulations are put in place.
o  AI tutors and teaching assistants can give every student a personalized tutor and every teacher an AI assistant. This could help address the ""two sigma problem"" of improving student outcomes.
o  The speaker shows examples of an AI called Khanmigo helping students learn math, coding, literature, and writing. It provides tailored feedback and encouragement.
o  Khanmigo can also be used by teachers to help create lesson plans, grade assignments, and prepare to teach new topics. This could save teachers a lot of time currently spent on administrative tasks.
o  While some are optimistic or pessimistic about AI, the speaker argues we should take an active role in ensuring it's developed and applied responsibly. If we pause progress out of fear, others may accelerate their AI for negative uses. But we must also fight for positive use cases like using AI to enhance human intelligence and potential."

It is one of the first ed-tech startups I knew, which has been committed to the vision of enhancing school education. I have donated to Khan Academy for a while but haven't yet done so recently, but I don't think I'll be able to sustain it given that I'm not earning. However, I'm super excited about what Khanmigo is bringing to the table and about the state of generative AI."
368,2023-06-27T14:32:34Z,@mohammadhosseineslamian,"One-sided and only promotional. The paper that Sal mentioned is credible but dates back to 1984. So why not mention the downsides and flaws of generative AI? What about inaccuracies, human agency, privacy, and bias?!

I found this video not critical enough for a CEO that promotes critical thinking in education! 

Children are a sensitive group that should be kept safe, and an AI that can share feelings and secrets needs to have specific boundaries and limitations."

371,2023-06-24T23:22:16Z,@alexd9597,"The first question I would ask: what does being ""objective"" really mean?
Say- if we were to ask the AI to grade a whole student body, a school for example- on a piece of creative writing- how would the grades received by the students from the AI, correlate with the grades between different teachers. What would that tell us about the AI and the teachers? 
How would we make an optimal ""marking"" machine, while improving ourselves by using it?
How do we even begin to decide what a ""statistical anomaly is"", when the question is no longer- concensus, but optimization. 

The obvious answer is trial and error, but the thing you are playing with here- education, is not unimportant. In fact, if the ""error"" part goes really wrong, that's a recipe for apocalypse. Terrible education and unsustainable beliefs are the most likely thing that might end our existence. That's my opinion though. I just don't want to see us fail."

A lot of nations barely have access to constant electricity, water etc., not to talk of even easy and constant access to the internet. How many developing nations have schools, even Universities, with constant internet talk less of access to Khanmigo? 

Kudos to you, developed countries can utilise this and keep being developed while developing countries try to sort themselves out. 

Within those developing countries, it is mostly the upper middle class and upper class that would be able to access and utilise such technologies at the start and for a good period of time, leaving behind the majority of the masses. 

I do not want a world where only the privileged have access to good quality education. I know you are doing your best @Sal Khan @khanmigo, but please look into how you can bridge this educational and digital gap in developing countries. Don't leave the rest of the developing world behind."

I agree with all of this except maybe using Khanmigo for guidance counseling. The demo showed that it could be helpful with basic academic planning but to take the place of a quality counselor requires empathy and sentience that AI doesn't have (and will never have) though I think it can be a helpful tool for counselors in managing their high case loads. Also could be helpful with writing individualized assessment plans for students with disabilities, there is a huge national shortage that backlogs thousands of cases. This tool can automate the admin tasks that overwhelm and distract educators from the classroom. I can't wait to see more"

Sal Khan's insights shed light on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in the field of education. His vision of using AI as a tool to personalize and enhance learning experiences resonates deeply. It's inspiring to see how AI can support teachers, empower students, and create a more inclusive and engaging educational environment. Khan's emphasis on leveraging technology to unlock human potential is both timely and encouraging. This talk reminds us that when used responsibly and ethically, AI has the power to revolutionize education for the better. Thank you, TED and Sal Khan, for sharing this enlightening perspective."

496,2023-05-14T18:31:10Z,@Me__Myself__and__I,"This is really impressive and could absolutely be a game changer for education.  Unfortunately he's quite wrong when it comes to the last couple minutes of this talk.  We can't wait for ""when the problems arise"" because, for AI, that is too late.  None of the past is relevant to this new situation, because we've never had to deal with what is effectively alien entities with intelligence on par to or greater than our own.  That makes this completely different than anything humans have faced before.  If we let AIs get smarter than humans without dealing with all the safety aspects BEFORE THEN it will be too late.  This is a situation where humanity can't wait until there are problems to try and fix them after the fact.  I'd like to point out that all the positive thinking in the world regarding education won't matter - if there aren't humans to educate in the future.  On our current path with attitudes like this (towards AI safety) where we race ahead building AIs that are well beyond what we can ensure safety for will lead to a horrible outcome for humanity.  It doesn't need to be that way, but doing it safely would require patience and a focus on safety instead of rapid unchecked progress but too many people just don't take AI safety seriously and if this trend continues it has a high likelihood of leading to disaster."

583,2023-05-08T19:49:52Z,@natekoch27,"Khan's example about analyzing the Great Gatsby is one of the dumbest, most dangerous things I've ever seen an educator suggest. Is that something a real-life reading tutor would do in a million years? Pretend to be the main character of the book so that they can pedantically explain the book's symbolism? What reading skill, what critical thinking skill, is that conversation supposed to be encouraging? Are we supposed to be teaching students that the protagonist of a novel is the best authority on the symbolism of that novel? Khan is patting this student on the back for reading Spark Notes in a slightly more tech savvy, nerdy way. How can people watch this man and think he has any clue what's good for students in an English Literature class? 

This is lunacy!! We've drank the Silicon Valley kool-aid, and there's only one direction this is going... the absolute collapse of critical thinking, which will lead to endemic depression and addiction among adults. The trend is already here. I promise you, students today are NOT going to look back on this time and think ""Wow, I'm so glad that an AI did 50% of my school work for me, I'm so much better off for it!"" You might argue that schools will raise standards to adjust for the abilities of AI. If you believe that, you must not work in a public school. Districts are fighting tooth and nail just to show basic proficiency on end-of-year exams. We're in a race to the bottom, and AI is anything but a golden bullet."

That's really powerful and something teachers struggle with because of large student numbers in Indian classrooms.

But there is something about knowing that what you are learning can be done effortlessly and better (assuming it is an effective tutor) by the bot teaching you that challenges the practical utility of the learning.

However, you have to give space for a long thought to a simple question: Does this democratization of AI-tutors could possibly get rid of the ""human connection"" in one of the very basic aspects of our life, i.e., education. I hope in such an influenctial and potential position Mr. Sal khan could comment on his thoughts about this. 

On the other hand, he has not mentioned a single aspect about the data that this AI has trained on and would train on in the future. What kind of biases or errors are hidden in this data? Who screens this data? 
This probably is going to be the most impactful AI tool ever and it is going to touch every learning child and adult in the corners of the world. So, these and more questions need to be listened to and debated in length especially by the creators of these tools. Otherwise they are just being irresponsible and/or getting distracted in awe of what their creation can achieve. And there are one-too-many examples in history of the consequences of such a direction."

686,2023-05-05T15:49:59Z,@GPTAsk,"The speaker in this text argues that AI can transform education by providing every student on the planet with an artificially intelligent personal tutor and every teacher with an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant. This, he says, can mitigate the fears that students will use AI to cheat, thereby not learning, and completely undermine education as we know it. The speaker demonstrates the early stages of their AI, Khanmigo, which is being used to tutor students in math, computer programming, and other subjects. Khanmigo can detect student mistakes, ask students to explain their reasoning, and help them to better understand concepts. It can also quiz students, answer their questions, and connect the video content they are watching with other ideas. The speaker says that using AI to provide every student with an amazing personal tutor could be the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen."
687,2023-05-05T15:47:57Z,@florencewebb2622,"No recognition at all of the importance of human connection in education, especially pre-college.  When a student feels cared about, cheered on, recognized as a person of value by a teacher, the result can be and often is transformative.  Even if AI could be taught to mimic that, the student would know there‚Äôs no person there.  If they were fooled into thinking of AI as a person, that would be psychologically fraudulent and might have very negative consequences down the road."

Or perhaps I want to learn about Ai itself, and how to get the most out of all the various models I'm hearing about that allow people to create images, music, animations, etc.  It's such a complex and confusing and fast moving subject, I'd love to be able to dive in and learn and have someone or something to answer questions along the way."

735,2023-05-04T19:36:52Z,@arencohen,"A great talk and exciting to see how Khan Academy is approaching this thoughtfully and with optimism. I adore that Khanmigo is being taught to ""think"" before it ""speaks."" A novel concept. Still many questions. Top of my list: At what age does the Khan Academy team think kids should be exposed to AI? How will the data from student's conversations with Khanmigo be presented to teachers in a way that's useful? Will using Khanmigo for lesson planning lead to better or more uniform pedagogy? How do we prepare students to discern and differentiate between speaking with an AI powered historical figure vs. fictional character vs. inanimate object (the Mississippi River?). The two sigma data is interesting and relevant. How much thought is being put into where these tools dovetail with children's cognitive development and differences, including supporting executive function development. Based on Sal's comments at the end of the talk, he clearly believes human interaction matters... but I'm curious about his specific thoughts on the where/why/when/how?"

For the cloud code example, it is better to teach the student how to reason and figure it out on their own, rather than explaining one sample. As a teacher, I would ask the student, what did you change to make the result you see now? Help them make the connection AND develop problem solving skills. That's critical to learning and not just being told answers."

The paradigm of coercive schooling is fundamentally broken and no amount of tinkering, AI-powered or otherwise, is going to fix it. We need to abolish the 'coercion' in schooling, i.e. the paradigm that we can and should force students to learn and force them to learn what we think students should or need to learn.

The new paradigm is free learning, self-learning, democratic education where passions actually drive every student's learning. We need to let go of the power and empower students to say NO to whatever does not interest them."

764,2023-05-04T14:13:46Z,@timbuelow4132,"I don't know if this is going to be a Super Tutor.  Here is the problem: all this is doing is giving on demand replies based on information that is already out there.  There is certainly efficacy in that.  However, education is fundamentally a human experience.  It's about people, peers, elevating one another into discourse communities.  So while we can ""learn"" more quickly because the information is now more on demand than it was before, it does nothing to really elevate human beings.  Only human beings can do that.  So while I think this will be helpful, it is not going to shift the curve like that shown at the beginning of the talk. In the end, unless teachers and students bring the necessary energy and eagerness to the experience (which AI cannot and never will be able to provide) AI will remain souped up search engine and nothing more."

776,2023-05-04T11:13:42Z,@therealfocusin,"I love Khan academy and this Khanmigo sounds great but lets be honest here for a sec. Only a very small group of students will use AI as a companion or tutor. The more likely scenario is they'll straight ask 'write me a horror story' and they'll sculp it from there 'make the lead character a ghost', 'write in more detail about the haunted house' and so on.
Also, people that's creative enough don't have the need for an AI companion, maybe only if they're really stuck and they're in the need of ideas. Keep this in mind, the same day this was released Chegg stock went down almost 50% because they lost a lot of their students clients to AI. This is only going to accelerate, the entire education system is about to make a 180¬∞ degrees turn, there will be less schools, less teacher, less infrastructure will be needed, the way professional credentials are achieved is going to change completely, because most of what you learn at school or in the university is useless and AI will expose that. The entire education system will need to change (finally) if it wants to adapt and survive."

802,2023-05-04T02:30:42Z,@sharmashyam,"I lost all the thousand ton of respect that I had for Sal Khan after listening to this talk. First, he's going to ""give"" ""everyone"" in the ""world"" -- you got the point -- he's THAT filled with a strange brown man's burden filled by Sillicon Valley. Khan Academy has been a blessing for those who have had access to it. But look at the attempts to give laptops to kids around the world. Look at the increasing digital divide. And Khan should know about the world beyond California. He may be right about AI's ability to do the math and even do a thousand things with language. But he's looking at the world through his company's lens alone: he's lost perspective (or perspectives). The ""super tutor"" is fine -- but wouldn't it need to first become capable of ""factually correct"" answers on simple issues, not to mention leaving it alone to guide children?! He seems to believe AI is going to tackle complexities of history and philosophy, and he also seems to believe it can help students with current events. All that while, he completely ignores that these tools are only good with the most motivated students.  AI tools are extremely helpful in some cases, hit or miss, but they are also based on the fundamental flaw: they're agnostic to facts, contexts, cultures, and ethics BY DESIGN, unless certain behaviors are subtracted from them, and that doesn't go very far. I wouldn't be so bothered by this presentation if it wasn't done like a promo, instead of an educator making a critical and nuanced assessment -- and we know why: Khan has money to make from this marketing. I've lost my trust of him entirely because of this."

However does it create two more problems for every one it solves? The gain could be achieved by simply providing better training for teachers and teaching assistants,  challenging though it might be. Human teachers when well trained can support and encourage their students in ways AI at the current level can not. But what we find is that students will by default go to a chatbot to ask questions or help on their homework even if their teachers are good (due to social or psychological factors) and become increasingly dependant on owners of these AI platforms whose policy may or may not always be in the students' best interest."

828,2023-05-03T19:30:09Z,@DavidVeal,"I would ask AI to figure how we can bring more people into teaching, how do we develop individualized learning. How we convince school boards to end the standard school system, and make a better system. Like a school being a learning center that is open 24/7. Teachers are guides, end grades and class periods. Students would never be late, would have responsibility for their own learning.This tutor concept can be helpful in that atmosphere. More so then in the large classrooms. I mean, go for critical thinking, and support the students in their passions. What really interferes with learning are emotional blocks."

Further it doesn't get annoyed, so I can keep asking ""why"" as many times to explain something.

Why isn't this cheating if I'm using it for assignments - well if you have used chat gpt everything it does is so artificial, fake and not real you cannot use it other than asking for layouts etc. - which how is this any differrent to the advice your teacher gives you on assigments."

law has multiple issues: not enough lawyers, not enough judges, not enough courts. the result is almost all cases end in a plea deal and lawyers are incentivized to push their clients towards a plea deal.

for doctors and educators though the 1 on 1 care is SO MUCH better than what we have. having a doctor who knows you beyond just your test results, who can give you their full undivided attention will give you much better outcomes than one who is seeing hundreds of patients.

might be a while before we see doctors or lawyers replaced by AI, the legal structure wouldn't allow for it."

950,2023-05-02T19:05:00Z,@glamastro,"Yeah, AI will be a great tool in  education moving forward, but the part that i think gets overlooked is if you want to still do the thing you were doing before.

Like interacting with AI is a lot of fun, using it to co-write stories is a blast... have it teach me in a way no teacher or even the biggest group of teachers possibly can is all great, but the teal question is will the students still want to learn? 

And the thing about mastery is, it is quite falsely human defined. 
Like imagine struggling with test as a 7th grader. You did not do well. Now, years later, you could attempt the same test and absolutely dominate easily. 

Imagine if on the basis of that 7th grade test, all career paths were laid down before you. It would be horrible  because you did so badly. 

That is precisely what happens, although later in life. It's not like you couldn't do well if given more time (clearly you can), its that society broadly defines the way you should do  well in a given timeframe, and enter society based on that result.  Society actively stunted your growth... 

Motivation is quite complicated,  and all points i make will have exceptions, but think about the internet. A hub of all information ever known to mankind.

What did it do to the population? Did it make everyone super smart?Did most people actively learn beyond their schooling years? No, it made the majority mindless scrollers, masked haters, and cringey short video creators  with ever so decreasing positive traits(again, not all, but many).. 

So, tools are great if they are helping with what you are trying to accomplish. Though most  radical tools change the very thing you try to accomplish, and in this day and age, its mostly negative."

1035,2023-05-02T07:13:56Z,@polymloth,"First of all, I agree that AI can be an absolutely fantastic tutor. BUT I have to point out some flaws in his argumentation. The statistic shown in the beginning on student success with and without tutoring hasn‚Äôt taken into account the type of students who opt for tutoring. And generally, his argument is placed on the premise that ‚Äúeveryone wants a tutor‚Äù. But no, they don‚Äôt. Some people really don‚Äôt want to learn and would rather take the easiest way out to stay above grade x.  (And this isn‚Äôt to say that some are dumb and some are smart. Highly intelligent people also often find ways to avoid learning things that are uninteresting and therefore trivial to them.) AI will be an absolute game changer for all of those who are curious but it‚Äôll be very difficult to get the students with not much curiosity towards academic matters to use these AI tutoring tools autonomously. Some people are more inclined to work with their hands or do physical labour and I think we really need to pay attention to these people to avoid creating an even larger social divide between the academically inclined and the not-so-much-so. 
So no, I don‚Äôt think we should try to take it slow with AI, but rather, to take advantage of it as efficiently as possible while making sure it doesn‚Äôt disproportionately benefit only a certain group of people, or in this case, only certain types of students."

Normally when someone is intelligent we place value on all of their opinions. This is because it is obvious that all of their opinions will go through the filter that is their intelligence. But with GPT people will do the same, placing value on all of its opinions due to its perceived intelligence, not realizing that GPT is ultimately controlled by a host of people of varying intelligence levels and massive biases and political agendas. Even if GPT was not controlled it would still be pulling its information from an assortment of people, including fallible people."

Imagine instead of attempting to craft AGI, we instead focused on creating subject matter experts with complete knowledge of every paper and book in existence on that topic, complete with full bibliography and ability to, create a textbook, create a lecture, issue and grade assignments and suggest research questions for graduate students and researchers. Imagine that instead of publish or die, we have professors capable of comfortably teaching 250 students, with AI assisted individualized attention, while getting 20+ papers published a month, with pre-publishing pre-peer review bots to speed up the rate of paper publishing and making it easier for editors. In a handful of years, the world could change beyond our wildest dreams."

Well, personally, all my life I felt like people like college professors, they act in a certain manner, which can be considered ""not real"", but why should you care, focus on what you can learn.

This applies directly to AI models as well when it comes to teaching. In real world, majority of teachers just cannot pay individual attention and cannot possibly cater the specific needs of a single student. But with AI, it is very much possible.

I love this. This ChatGPT wave since November only brought 1 thing in my life. Ease of access to knowledge and understanding. And I'm glad it happened.

What if little Sanji had to work 2 part time jobs to help her parents with the rent and health insurance payments? And ramen noodles. If you thought that's a fragment you're 110% correct! The brainiacs keep talking about education and jobs like these things are gonna inevitably put food on the table. Those were the days! If the AI doesn't come with a built-in UBI money spitting nozzle, then it's an unsafe product. It's trained on OUR data! You don't need to wait for Congress to make safety regulations; you can be pro-active! Back in the day when Tesla was electrifying our homes did he ask Diane Feinstein and Mitch McConnell about the size of the wires he should use?! No, I didn't think so! üòÇ
UBI is a must. It's not gonna come from those stingy bastards in gov't. Tech needs to provide it even to those who fall on the left side of the bell curve."

Totalitarianism is already here and tech advancements are the means to carry this out. AI is the accelerator. You just dont know it because the erosion of freedoms is tactfully slow and methodical, generational even.

We will all eventually be dependent on outsourcing our thinking to AI. The same way we do with navigation, remembering and reminding, dating, finding work, etc. etc.

And those in control of the machines (be it AI or humans) will learn the prompts to control the masses into an obedient, happy slaves under the guise of progress, innovation, and... my personal favorite, democracy."

The cases discussed in the video about student debt relief and the Spanish American war are cases in point.  The answers in the video contain political perspectives.  Bias, if you will. Power corrupts.  And the power to control the AI responses should not be entrusted to corruptible people.  Which is all of us. There should be a search for truth, not an attempt to manipulate via propaganda."
