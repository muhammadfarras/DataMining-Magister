Brahim was rong Modrić is from my country and iven if he might be a little older than the other's he is still playing at such a high level of FOOTBALL and he is one of the best midfilders of all-time in FOOTBALL then he gives a great pass to Brahim and then Brahim just stayed still over there and did nothing RIGHT while Modrić did anything RIGHT and then everyone is blaming Modrić which I totally  disagree who is with me?

266,2025-05-02T05:05:24Z,@Dani-v8t8l,Modric chose the most dangerous pass of all his options AND it was a weak pass  to Brahim whose momentum was carrying him towards goal. Look at the video and deal with it. Modric made a bad pass and should probably retire as he also is part of the arrogant and lazy players Madrid needs to get rid of.

They never miss their mark on the ball pass, when you doesn't get it, it means you are at the wrong position to receive the ball. Meanwhile, selfish is what killing your teammates and teams if you always want to score which you should have pass the ball so the chances of having a goals is high, but footballers nowadays always doesn't get it. You can shoot the ball but if your teammates have a better chance on converting that ball to goals, it's better to pass the ball to them. To all Barcelona fans, I wanna say that congratulations to Barcelona for winning the Copa Del Rey and Kounde for fast reaction to get the ball and scoring the winning goal. For Real Madrid, they need to focus on La Liga and give Don Carlo a proper goodbye this season if he ever to leave again. I heard that he will likely goin to leave this season, so thank you so much for everything you have done Don Carlo 🚬🙌🏻. If they need a new manager, they need to hire someone like Xabi from Bayer Leverkusen, he might can manage this young players and need to be given a long time to settle down."

607,2025-04-30T17:10:54Z,@yassinedderraz9946,"It's the coach's fault. If you notice how the players are unfocused and afraid of losing, what with Rodrygo's performance in previous matches? However, the coach didn't replace him for Guler or Ibrahim. And what about Bellingham's level? Isn't he a playmaker? Imagine a playmaker who doesn't create plays. And let's not forget the mistake Courtois made, and because of his exit from the goal, we conceded a goal that came in the last five minutes of the match, before extra time."

670,2025-04-30T13:57:22Z,@Imola99,That was still a poor decision from Modric. Never play a ball across your box because that’s exactly what happens. In the 115th min before pens. Why take that risk? Modric is at fault too.
671,2025-04-30T13:53:12Z,@Shourya-i8h,No it’s brahim fault because he was not scanning
672,2025-04-30T13:51:23Z,@mphilebiyela7426,Brahim is  just selfish
673,2025-04-30T13:50:05Z,@Footy_savage,Brahmin was expecting counter attack. Hence he was moving away from the ball. Modrić pass died on him. I think it’s the legend’s fault.

691,2025-04-30T13:05:36Z,@teslabX,"Stop dreaming and getting emotional. Modrić is a great player, but in this situation, he messed up. Brahim was already sprinting forward, but a weak, backward pass from Modrić wrong-footed him and killed the momentum, allowing the opponent to intercept. That’s all. The fact that he blamed Brahim only makes him look smaller, instead of taking responsibility"

After screwing up the other chances, he slipped on the most critical moment of the match.... not fit to play first team football at Real Madrid. Blaugrana Nation sends its thanks! 🤣😂

834,2025-04-30T06:33:30Z,@lordkoro1446,lol the pass was so poor from a midfielder if you see brahim position was asking for a run but modric made this poor pass behind his back lol you r being unfair and emotional that was modric mistake
835,2025-04-30T06:32:29Z,@rayfox-xs2dg,"We don’t blame modric, we blame the referee. As always tho"
836,2025-04-30T06:27:35Z,@courageapenk2369,Brahim wanted to delay the match with the ball so that we can end up at penalties but lie lie kounde said no way. I can’t play penalty better so a for try take the ball and try my left short see den boom we killed madrid. Pains straight to Madrid 😝😝😝😝
837,2025-04-30T06:21:15Z,@jervi2391,Definitely not modric fault

862,2025-04-30T04:59:42Z,@ZangpoSherpa-mb5yb,Brahim waited for ball pass was accurate by Modric but Brahim let the ball come towards him waiting instead of approaching towards ball. So Kounde scored while Brahim was waiting the ball to come towards him.

867,2025-04-30T04:43:21Z,@bnqassem5821,"Brahim had much space and trusted that he would receive the ball comfortably .. what most people did not notice is that when this is supposed to be a counter strike, how brave is kounde as a RB to be midfield and push that fast to the ball with the choice of shooting instead of retreating with the chance of losing the ball to brahom. I say both made no mistakes and kounde had his moment right there."

It was a terrible pass amd thats a fact, brahim was clearly running foward and modric played a weak pass towards were he was instead of were he was going to be. If it was ceballos or any none big name player who played that pass, everyone would agree that it was a bad pass. One of the basic things you're taught in football is to never pass across your box unless you're very sure the pass is going through and modric played a very weak pass across his box. He's one of the greatest midfielders of all time but he's human and he made a mistake. Stop shifting the blame to someone else"

1024,2025-04-29T18:46:57Z,@lachlach4269,"Modric is a legend but a human being too , first the pass  to the middle of your 20 yard box is a rookie mistake, the pass also was slow , Brahmin expected the pass to be strong so he anticipated a counter attack  and started the run then realised that the ball wasn’t reaching him and stopped to come back “too late “ meanwhile koundé read the pass and intercepted it the rest is history. You can see Modric raised his hands he knew it wasn’t right . Yes  it’s Modric fault . Also yes Brahmi didn’t pass to Arda in 2 occasions where Arda was in better position."

We can just dream about it."
1138,2025-04-29T11:56:45Z,@TheDragon-m2x,Brahim had to look around to see if he is on pressure. If he saw Kounde he was going to run to the ball and get it quickly before Kounde. He was going to have a lot of options than. And just he was substituted just almost on the end of the second quarter. HE HAD TO GIVE HIS ALL
1139,2025-04-29T11:53:50Z,@YTKYMO,Bro I know that it was a bad match for brahim but he should have went towards ball and not wait for the ball to reach him.but W match❤

1220,2025-04-29T06:35:58Z,@SSM_EditzOG,Honestly endrick and Brahmin Diaz are better than rodrygo and Vinci this season. This one gamw cannot define how good Brahmin Diaz. And if you say he does not pass jut because he didn’t pass to guler once than you are crazy. Brahim if anything passes too much. A reason I think brahim diaz had a bad game is because his confidence is down as he has not played a lot. Hate me or not but as I said THIS SEASON brahim Diaz is better than Vinicius jr and could have wayyy better stats than Vini if he played more.

1288,2025-04-29T02:12:07Z,@CptCadoodles,Modric. It’s football 101 to never pass the ball weakly through the centre.

1299,2025-04-29T00:58:22Z,@marmadon8835,I completely disagree a real football veteran would agree that it was modric’s fault the reason for that is because as a middle fielder you have the pass the ball as hard as possible so the pass gets to its destination. Especially when you are a professional. Because as a professional touch isn’t a problem.

It’s not just about Brahim. Even legends like Modrić have been disrespected, and many others before them too.

We're supposed to love and support the club and the players, whether we win or lose. Sadly, we lack this spirit as Madridistas. Look at Barcelona fans. Even during their worst seasons, they stood by their players and their club. Meanwhile, we turn our backs at the smallest inconvenience.

Mistakes happen occasionally, sometimes even every game, but that doesn't mean a player is a loser or a failure. Criticize if you want, but show some respect. Don’t forget Brahim has made us all lose our minds with joy in so many games since he returned from Milan.

Support the team, not just when it's easy, but especially when it's hard. Hala Madrid!"

HE SLIPPED BECAUSE HE HAD LOST THE BALL. KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

This is it, he waited too long for the ball instead of going for it.

The pass was hit low and slow to ease control  while the game was on a high intensity at that moment. Any player with ball knowledge would step towards the ball instead of waiting 3 months for the ball to find him. He wanted to react suddenly, after seeing that Kounde had arrived the ball, and that's what made him slip. Late reaction.

1445,2025-04-28T19:10:40Z,@Borna-gj1zm,Brahim is bad but really
1446,2025-04-28T19:07:19Z,@angel2x.,"Let me settle this once and for all. Its BRAHIMS FAULT. 
1. Wasnt aware of his surroundings near his own box( BIG NO,NO)
2. Misjudged the ball speed and started backtracking before the ball was even close. 
3. You have fresh legs your job is to go towards the ball get it under control and dribble up the pitch ( less chance of loose touches unlike the rest of the team that has been playing from the start. ) 

If you still try argue that modrics weight of pass was the issue you should NEVER consider playing in the midfield."

The Gerrard slip was just bad coordination with a lil bit of bad luck while brahims mistake literally came down to poor awareness."
